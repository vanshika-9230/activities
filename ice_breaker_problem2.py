'''Electromagnetic radiation can be classified into one of 7 categories according to its
frequency, as shown in the table below:

Radio Waves Less than 3 × 10^9
Microwaves 3 × 10^9 to less than 3 × 10^12
Infrared Light 3 × 10^12 to less than 4.3 × 10^14
Visible Light 4.3 × 10^14 to less than 7.5 × 10^14
Ultraviolet Light 7.5 × 10^14 to less than 3 × 10^17
X-Rays 3 × 10^17 to less than 3 × 10^19
Gamma Rays 3 × 10^19 or more

Write a program that reads the frequency of some radiation from the user and
displays name of the radiation as part of an appropriate message.'''
